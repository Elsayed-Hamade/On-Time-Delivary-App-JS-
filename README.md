# OnTime app for shipping ‚úà



# üí° Idea :

> With this app you can choose the desired place on the map
> that the company can ship your product to you.

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ First: You click on your location on the map
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second: Enter your product info in the form
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Third: Submit the order; if you want to delete it, you can do so via the delete button in the product.


# ‚õîNote :

this app is just an implementation of what I have learned from the course I study.
